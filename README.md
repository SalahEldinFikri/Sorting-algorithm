# Merge sort and Insertion sort

## Aim:
Writing a program to perform merge sort and insertion sort using C# programming and windows form.

## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs , labtop
2.  Visual studio 

## Algorithm:
## Merge Sort Algorithm:
1. Divide the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing 1 element.
2. Take adjacent pairs of two singleton lists and merge them to form a list of 2 elements. N will now convert into N/2 lists of size 2.
3. Repeat the process till a single sorted list of obtained.

## Insertion Sort Algorithm:
1.	Set the first element as sorted element j.
2.	For each unsorted element X, check if current sorted element j >X.
3.	If yes, move sorted element to the right by 1.
4.	Break the loop and insert X.
5.	Repeat the steps 2 to 4 for sorting all the elements in the array.

## After you start the program you will have to chose the way you want to sort the array.

## After you chose the way you will input the elemnets in the textbox one after another and you have to click insert to insert the element to the array.
